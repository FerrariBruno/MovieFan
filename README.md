This is my training project for [Xmartlabs](https://xmartlabs.com) Android team.

## Style guide

The app follows the [style guide](https://github.com/xmartlabs/Android-Style-Guide)
used in all the Android apps. If you're going to make a contribution please follow
it too.

## Code review process

Any code that you want to contribute to the project is welcome. However,
before it is accepted, at least one member of the team must validate and approve
the changes, preferably more than one.

Please request the review by creating a Pull Request. Always include
a clear description of what the changes are. A basic template can be
found [here](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
